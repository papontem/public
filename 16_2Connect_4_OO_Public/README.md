# Connect 4 Objects Oriented Project

This is a public repo of the Object Oriented version of the Connect 4 project from earlier that i helped to complete by refactoring some of the starter code that I was provided.

## How To Play

    - Pick your colors, then click on the start button. colors can be any valid css color value, be it by name, hex code or rgb(0,0,0) etc. Heres a list: https://w3schools.sinsixx.com/css/css_colorsfull.asp.htm
    - Default is red for player 1 and blue for player 2.
    - A board will appear with 6x7 grid of 50x50 pixel squares.
    - At the top of the board are boxes with dashed outlines, a target when you hover over them and its where you can drop a piece down a column by clicking them.
    - Two players alternate placing pieces down on the board.
    - The first player to get four in pieces in a row horrizontaly, vertically or diagonally wins the game.
    - If the board fills up and no player was able to get four in a row, the game ends in a tie/draw.

## ToDo:

    - Make it so that you can have more than two players
    - Style it Up: add animations, better graphics for the board or pieces, and other CSS ideas. Could even use bootstrap for things like modals for the start-new-game form.
    - Make a very simple computer player: it could pick a random column and place a piece there. a ComputerPlayer class?
